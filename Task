Task

The application named MovieWorld is a social sharing platform where users can share their favorite movies of all time.

Each movie has a title and a small description as well as a date that corresponds to the date it was added to the database.

In addition it holds a reference to the user that submitted it.

Users can also express their opinion about a movie by liking, hating or commenting each one.

When an unauthorized user visits the application, a list of movies that have been added to the database is displayed, as well as links for log in / sign up.

Each movie contains the following information:

● Title
● Description
● Name of the user 
● Date of publication 
● Number of likes
● Number of hates
● Number of comments

The name of the user is a link that, when clicked, filters the movies down to the items that have been shared by this specific user.
The number of votes is a link that, when clicked, it shows list of users who have voted a movie.
The number of comments is a link that, when clicked, it shows list of users who have commented a movie.

The list can also be sorted by the number of likes, number of hates, number of comments or the publication date.

In addition, authorized users are able to:
  - Add, edit or delete their own movies and express their opinion for other movies by either liking, hating a movie or by retracting their vote. Voting is performed by clicking on the respective links that are displayed for each movie.
  - Add a comment for other movies. Commenting is performed by clicking on the respective links that are displayed for each movie.

Admin user should also be created by default and should be able to edit / delete any movie or see list of users who have voted or commented a movie.
